                I consider myself to be a great travel blogger, but there are so
                many others with unique perspectives and stories. While I’ve
                seen and experienced so much, I’m not an expert in all
                destinations and topic areas. As a 29-year old man, I don’t
                cover niche areas like family travel and woman travel like other
                travel blogs can. For these reasons, I am super excited to share
                my favorite travel blogger websites around the world, ranging
                from solo travelers and backpackers to family adventure blogs
                and luxury jetsetters. These trailblazers have inspired me to
                get out and travel, and I’m confident they will fuel your
                wanderlust, too! I consider myself to be a great travel blogger,
